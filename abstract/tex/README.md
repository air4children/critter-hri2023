* Identifying challenges of cHRI in low-resource countries %Sat  4 Feb 17:30:45 GMT 2023
* Measuring engagement and collaboration in CRI activities 

## Abstract (250 words)
The field of Child-Robot Interaction, cHRI, has been made great progess in the last decade addressing challenges on child-centred programs, releasing of datasets, code and release of software to push forward the field.
However, there is little progress in cHRI in developing countries including India, South Africa, Mexico, and Brazil that faces different challenges:
* to the little to none experts in AI and Robotics,
* the high-cost of educational material.
There are pedagotical challenges on how to create inclusie child-centred material.
And qualitative and quantivative evaluation of engagment and collaboration in CRI activities (sharma2019).
Hence, this work aims to discuss state-of-the-art challangences of CRI in low-income countries.

Potential solutions
* Increase research funding
* Establishing networks, communities and facilities
* Fostering international collaborations
* Create training programs

## Motivation for participation (Character limit: 600)
My motivations to partcipate in CRITTER are twofold:
* To link up with researchers with similar research interets in developing technologies for CRI with the aim of creating an online community (slack, discout, etc)
* To participate in disucssions on how to make sustanilable tools and how to deal with ethical data of children.

## Motivation of contribution (Character limit: 600)
To create more visibility to air4children project that address challenges in creating CRI with limited resources.
Also, to bring to discussion potential solutions and disucss the furture of CRI in limited resoruces countires

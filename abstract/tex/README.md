## Abstract (250 words)
The field of Child-Robot Interaction, cHRI, has been made great progress in the last decade, advancing child-centred programs, and releasing datasets, code and software.
There has been little progress in cHRI research in developing countries including India, South Africa, Mexico, and Brazil.
However, there are different challenges:
* to the little to none experts in AI and Robotics,
* the high-cost of educational material.
* There are pedagogic al challenges on how to create include child-centred material.
* And qualitative and quanti votive evaluation of engagement and collaboration in CRI activities (sharma2019).
Hence, this work aims to discuss state-of-the-art challenges of cHRI in low-income countries.

Potential solutions
* Increase research funding
* Establishing networks, communities and facilities
* Fostering international collaborations
* Create training programs

## Motivation for participation (Character limit: 600)
My motivations to participated in CRITTER are twofold:
* To link up with researchers with similar research interests in developing technologies for cHRI with the aim of creating an online community (slack, discount, etc)
* To participate in discussions on how to make sustainable tools and how to deal with ethical data of children.

## Motivation of contribution (Character limit: 600)
To create more visibility of air4children project that address challenges in creating cHRI with limited resources.
Also, to discussion potential solutions and to discus the future of cHRI in limited resources countries.

Challenges in Child-Robot Interaction, cHRI, in low-resource and middle-resource countries

## Abstract (250 words)
The field of Child-Robot Interaction, cHRI, has made great progress in the last decade, creating new child-centred programs, advancing the educational infrastructure with new code and software and open sourcing new datasets. 
cHRI faces different challenges in developing countries, including India, South Africa, Mexico, and Brazil. For instance, the project artificial intelligence and robotics for children, air4children, has been combining open-source hardware and software and non-traditional education to teach fundamentals of AI and Robotics in a small town in Mexico since 2014. 
However, there are various challenges in low-resource countries: (a) the little to none experts in Robotics and AI, (b) the high-cost of educational material (both for software and hardware), (c) the limited child-centred material aligned to the values of their communities, and (d) the qualitative and quantitative evaluation instruments for engagement and collaboration in cHRI activities. 
Hence, the aim of this abstract is to discuss state-of-the-art challenges and potential solutions of cHRI in low-income countries such as increasing research funding, establishing networks, communities and facilities, fostering international collaborations and creating training programs.

## Motivation for participation (Character limit: 600)
Our motivation to participate in CRITTER are twofold:
* To link up with researchers with similar cHRI research interests to create an online community (slack, discord, etc), and 
* To participate in discussions on how to make sustainable tools (including software and hardware), how to deal with the ethical data of children and potential next steps on creating an cHRI community.

## Motivation of contribution (Character limit: 600)
To create more visibility to the project artificial intelligence and robotics for children, air4children, that is addressing challenges creating cHRI with limited resources.
Also, to discuss potential solutions and to discuss the future of cHRI in countries with limited resources.

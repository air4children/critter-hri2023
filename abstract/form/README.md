## Abstract
Provide an abstract focusing on the central topic of interdisciplinary research in child-robot interaction (CRI).

Reflect on the key challenges in conducting child-robot interaction research (either from an empirical or theoretical/ethical viewpoint).
Study proposals which fit the theme of the workshop will also be considered.

Potential subjects include, but are not limited to
Quantitative and/or qualitative research methodology to assess child-robot interactions;
Theoretical reflections on the conceptualization and/or operationalization of constructs relevant to CRI;
Ethical reflections on settings and methods in/by which to assess child-robot interactions;
Design and technical implementation (Wizard of Oz, autonomous, or semi-autonomous) of robot systems and CRI scenarios and
Creation of appropriate and effective interaction content and social robot behaviors.
Submissions will be accepted based on the originality, clarity, and relevance of their contribution.
